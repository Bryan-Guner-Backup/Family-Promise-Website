## Advocating to End Family Homelessness

Family Promise believes that all children and their families deserve a safe place to call home.

In 1988, Family Promise became a national organization. Despite the rapid pace of change in the years since, family homelessness has remained a constant challenge, robbing families of their stability and children of their futures. Nevertheless, throughout our more than three decades of growth, two principles have persevered. First, as a community, we make a promise to support families during their most difficult times. Second, each family has the promise, the potential, to achieve sustainable independence when given the opportunity.

Family Promise advocates on local, regional, and national levels for policies that reinforce these principles. We are committed to being a leader in the fight against family homelessness, both as a service provider and as an advocate for legislation addressing the issues families we serve face.

## Featured Legislation

#### The Emergency Family Stabilization Act

Family Promise supports The Emergency Family Stabilization Act which would create new emergency funding streams administered by the Administration for Children and Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This funding would provide flexible funding for community-based organizations to meet the unique needs of children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness in the wake of the coronavirus.

To learn more, view the [**factsheet**](https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EFSA-Factsheet.pdf).

To take action by contacting your U.S. Senators, endorsing the legislation, or sharing on social media, [**click here**](https://www.schoolhouseconnection.org/efsa-introduced/#takeaction).

#### The Homeless Children and Youth Act (HCYA)

Family Promise advocates for the passage of the Homeless Children and Youth Act and for modifications to the way the Department of Housing and Urban Development defines homelessness.

In 2018, Affiliate Director, National Trustee, and Guest Advisory Council Member Kat Lilley-Blair testified to Congress about why Family Promise believes that HCYA needs to be passed.[](https://prosperitynow.org/blog/new-house-bill-would-fund-manufactured-housing-community-preservation?)

You can learn more about how to [**get involved with the fight to pass HCYA here**.](http://helphomelesskidsnow.org/facts/)

#### The Evictions Crisis Act

According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness:

_The Eviction Crisis Act (S. 3030) would establish a federal emergency housing assistance grant program which would provide aid to people experiencing housing insecurity in order to avert homelessness._

[**Learn more here**.](https://endhomelessness.org/legislation/eviction-crisis-act-of-2019/)

#### The Family Stability and Opportunity Vouchers Act

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition:

_The bill would create an additional 500,000 housing vouchers specifically designed for low-income families with young children in order to expand their access to neighborhoods of opportunity with high-performing schools, strong job prospects, and other resources. This bill could largely eliminate homelessness among families with young children, as well as substantially reduce the number of children growing up in areas of concentrated poverty._

#### The Manufactured Housing Community Preservation Act of 2020

According to Prosperity Now:

_The legislation would encourage states, localities and private actors to enter or expand their roles in the preservation of one of the nation’s largest sources of affordable housing._
