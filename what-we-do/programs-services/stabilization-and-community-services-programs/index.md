## Family Promise’s Stabilization Program

Helping the families we serve succeed today and creating transformational opportunities for tomorrow.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Homelessness has many causes and housing stability requires multiple solutions. Family Promise Affiliates nationwide have developed and implemented numerous programs that address every aspect of stabilization. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is not simply getting families into housing; it is keeping them in housing. Key to this is tapping into the diverse resources our volunteer pool and partnerships provide. Even more importantly, these programs create the basis for stability that lifts families from poverty and permits them to aspire to the future every family deserves.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples include: </span>

- - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tenancy training </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Home ownership </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial capability </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Educational initiatives </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Career pathways </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Technology support </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Health and wellness </span>

_Workforce development. Partners in Housing. Financial capability. Health and wellness._ Homelessness has many causes and housing stability involves many solutions. Family Promise Affiliates have developed and implemented more than 1,000 different programs that address every aspect of stabilization.

Some get to the heart of core needs, such as childcare and job training, families face in order to regain self-sufficiency. Other initiatives find ways to match the strengths of local volunteers and the interests of local corporations with the needs of our guests, like financial literacy and mentoring. Similarly, many initiatives build off core tenets of the foundational shelter program itself, leading to efforts like food assistance, furniture and clothing donation, and health and wellness programs.

Probably no community initiative is more vital than the many housing programs Affiliates run. Currently, 104 Affiliates nationwide serve individuals in housing programs, including Permanent Housing, Permanent Supportive Housing, Transitional Housing, and others. As of December 2018, Affiliates were providing nearly 2,000 beds outside of their emergency shelter programs to parents and their children.

But our goal is not simply getting families into housing; it is _keeping_ them in housing.

Key to this is identifying needs specific to the local community and tapping into the diverse resources our volunteer pool and partnerships provide. The result is families no longer at risk of homelessness.

Families like David Hill’s, who was a guest at Family Promise of Brevard (FL).

And, even more importantly, through programs we have launched for tenancy preparation, micro-entrepreneurship, and virtual career pathway training, Affiliates create the basis for security and stability that separates families from poverty and allows them and their children to aspire to the future every child deserves.

## COMMUNITY SERVICES

Everything we do at Family Promise involves volunteers.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We engage the community to offer families additional services. These services include: </span>

- - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Food pantries </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Furniture donation </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Drop-in community centers </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Clothing closets </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Diaper banks </span>
  - <span style="font-weight: 400;">Holiday gift drives </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that many of the solutions to homelessness already exist in the community. Congregations convert an old rectory to transitional housing. Affiliates partner with civic groups to create childcare. Volunteers supply families with good quality vehicles—often the one element they may need to stay out of homelessness.</span>
