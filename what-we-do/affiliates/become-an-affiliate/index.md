Family Promise is the leading national organization preventing and ending family homelessness. Our approach involves prevention services before families become homeless, shelter to help families experiencing homelessness access housing, and stabilization programs once families have secured housing.

Family Promise has a proven strategy for creating Affiliates. The transformative outreach for civic groups, faith communities, and corporations alike is a highly successful solution to preventing and ending homelessness. Affiliates may provide Prevention, Shelter, Stabilization, and/or Housing services to their community.

To begin the process of becoming a Family Promise Affiliate, please follow these next steps:

[Contact us](../../../contact/indexdcd0.html?subject=affiliates) to start the process. We will work with you to understand the need in your community and the current resources that exist for children and their families. We engage your community through virtual and in-person meetings and build local leadership. Family Promise provides extensive technical assistance, materials, and in some cases, access to grants and in-kind donations.

Launching an Affiliate happens in two ways. Affiliates develop either as a new nonprofit or as an existing nonprofit transitioning into a Family Promise Affiliate. To learn more about Affiliate Development, please contact the Director of Affiliate Expansion, Carolyn Gordon at 908-374-1100 x 148 or using the [Contact Form](#contact-form) below.

### Family Promise Programs You Can Launch

##### **Prevention**

Preventing families from being evicted and entering homelessness is an essential element of the Family Promise mission and the most cost-effective way to proactively address this crisis. Prevention costs a fraction of what sheltering a family costs.

Prevention includes formal shelter diversion programs that provide rental assistance and landlord mediation and utilize a community- based approach that keep families housed.

##### \*\* \*\*

##### **Shelter**

The shelter program is a cost-effective and efficient response to family homelessness because it leverages existing community resources, engages volunteers, includes case management, and can be implemented without major start-up costs. There are multiple models of shelter at Family Promise:

- - The rotational shelter engages a network of community partners to host families at a different location each week.
  - The static site does not rotate, and volunteers provide hospitality at the site.
  - The hybrid model is a combination of the rotational and static site.
  - The scattered site model leverages multiple locations such as apartments, motel rooms or multiple congregational spaces as temporary shelter for families.

##### \*\* \*\*

##### **Stabilization**

Stabilization supports families exiting shelter to secure and maintain housing. The goal is not simply getting families into housing; it is keeping them in housing. Key to this is tapping into the diverse resources our volunteer pool and partnerships provide.

Through programs such as tenancy preparation, financial capabilities and virtual career pathway training, Affiliates create the basis for stability that lifts families from poverty and permits them to aspire to the future every family deserves.

##### \*\* \*\*

##### **Housing**

Family Promise Housing programs seek to empower families to attain stable housing and rebuild their lives. In 2020, more than 60% of Family Promise Affiliates offered at least one type of housing program including permanent supportive housing, affordable housing, and bride apartments. By doing so, Affiliates have had a transformative impact.

In-Kind Donations to Affiliates

The reason our Affiliate has achieved so many goals is that we are part of a much larger sum.  The presence of the national movement has won us respect in our city for the work we do. We are strengthened by our ability to reach for guidance from a national team and the collect team of Affiliates.
