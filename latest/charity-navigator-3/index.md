**SUMMIT, NJ – April 12, 2021** – Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit fighting to end family homelessness, has received [a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9926), America’s largest independent charity evaluator. This is the eighth consecutive time that Family Promise has achieved this distinction, a distinction given to only six percent of rated nonprofits.

Charity Navigator evaluates charities and issues rated nonprofits a numeric score, based on financial health and governance practices, that is then used to generate a star rating. This year, Family Promise earned a perfect score of 100 out of 100 points, [placing it among only 71 nonprofits across the nation to do so](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=2203). Charity Navigator awarded Family Promise its 4-star rating, the highest star rating available.

“Family Promise is committed to operating at the highest levels of ethics, financial health, accountability, and transparency. We owe that to our supporters and funders and are proud to be honored by Charity Navigator for achieving the 4-star standard for eight consecutive years,” said Claas Ehlers, Family Promise CEO.

Since 2002, using objective analysis, Charity Navigator has awarded only the most fiscally responsible organizations a 4-star rating. Ratings have evolved over the years to include metrics regarding financial health, governance practices, and accountability & transparency.

“Family Promise’s exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public,” said Michael Thatcher, Charity Navigator President and CEO. “Only a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating. This adds Family Promise to a preeminent group of charities working to overcome our world’s most pressing challenges. Based on its 4-star rating, people can trust that their donations are going to a financially responsible and ethical charity when they decide to support Family Promise.”

Family Promise’s rating and other information about charitable giving are [available free of charge](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9926). You can learn more about the impact of your donations to Family Promise [here](https://familypromise.org/the-latest/roi/).
