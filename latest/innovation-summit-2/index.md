## Family Promise Affiliates from across the U.S. come together at Innovation Summit to share best practices, insights, and inspiration.

**Summit, NJ — **This week, Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit working to prevent and end family homelessness in the U.S., hosted its second Virtual Innovation Summit. The event brought together over 200 local Family Promise Affiliates for two days of workshops, speeches, and discussions.

---

### Senator Cory Booker provided an inspirational message in support of Family Promise’s work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

---

### Amanda Andere inspired everyone at Family Promise to have the hard conversations necessary on the journey to racial justice.

[<img src="https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amanda-Andere-300x300.jpg" alt="Amanda Andere" class="wp-image-45638 size-medium alignleft" width="300" height="300" />](https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Amanda-Andere.jpg)The keynote speech was given by Amanda Andere, CEO of Funders Together to End Homelessness.

Amanda challenged Affiliates to lead with racial and housing justice to end homelessness and housing insecurity.

“Will you join me on the journey of hope? Will you shift from learning to action? Will you give up power to Black indigenous people and people of color, especially people with lived experience?” Amanda asked the audience.

---

### Claas Ehlers, CEO, and Sandra  Miniutti, COO of Family Promise discussed how “housing is justice.”

<img src="https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Housing-is-Justice-300x300.jpg" alt="Housing is Justice" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-45639" width="300" height="300" />

Our core values of empathy, hospitality, empowerment, innovative, dynamic, and community were key. Through all of our core values, there is a common theme: Justice. Bonding our dual missions of empowering families and mobilizing the community, we need to advance the righteous cause of ensuring every child has a home.

“We believe that families should have homes. We believe that the community is key to accomplishing that. And ultimately, we believe America should be a country where a child’s housing status does not define their future,” Claas said.

---

###  Attendees learned from workshops on a variety of topics.

[<img src="https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Zoom.jpg" alt="Screenshot of an innovation summit panel" class="aligncenter wp-image-45642 size-full" width="640" height="480" />](https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Zoom.jpg)

The Summit spanned two days and included multiple blocks of workshops with practical tips and learning opportunities for Affiliates.

Workshop topics included mindful leadership, implicit bias and microaggressions, technology essentials, and much more!
