> To the Asian community: We see you. We hear you. We stand with you.

> Family Promise is committed to fighting for a safe and equitable world.

#### About Family Promise’s Racial Justice Council

It is impossible to separate systemic and structural racism from the reality that people of color, and Black people, in particular, are disproportionately affected by homelessness and poverty. The Family Promise Racial Justice Council was formed to ensure we address racial equity issues in our work at all levels. The Council is comprised of Family Promise community members from across the country.
