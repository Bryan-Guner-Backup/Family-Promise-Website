## Family Promise to Host Summer Sleep-Out to Raise Awareness for Family Homelessness in America

**Summit, NJ – June 26, 2021 — **Family Promise, the nation’s leading organization fighting family homelessness, is hosting a summer sleep-out event on June 26, 2021. [Night Without a Bed](https://www.nightwithoutabed.org/?utm_source=Family%20Promise%20Website&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=Night%20Without%20a%20Bed) is a social media challenge that raises awareness for families experiencing homelessness.

We ask participants to sleep anywhere without a bed: cars, a tent, a treehouse, living room floor, a couch and use the hashtag \#NightWithoutABed to post a video blog or photo with a short blog entry to describe their experiences. In the run-up to the event, participants will challenge another friend to participate in \#NightWithoutABed or make a donation to Family Promise.

Every year in America, over 3 million children experience homelessness. These children are 8-9 times more likely to repeat a grade, 3 times more likely to be placed in special education programs, and 7 times more likely to attempt suicide. 42% will drop out of school at some point and 47% suffer from anxiety, depression, or withdrawal.

“Family homelessness was a national crisis long before the pandemic, but the health and economic challenges of the past year have put many more children at risk of experiencing homelessness,” said Cara Bradshaw, Chief Impact Officer. “On June 26th, we are asking the community to come together for Night Without a Bed and raise awareness for an issue that is often invisible.”
