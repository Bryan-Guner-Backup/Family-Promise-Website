## **National Organization Sees Increase in Number of U.S. Families Experiencing Homelessness**

**Summit, New Jersey, April 21, 2021 –** Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit working to prevent and end family homelessness, has seen an increase in families seeking assistance since the start of the Coronavirus Pandemic. In response to this, the organization is joining forces with its network of over 200 Affiliates across the U.S. to hold Family Promise Giving Day, a nationwide, digital awareness event on April 21, 2021.

Every year in America, 3 million children experience homelessness. For those who have never experienced homelessness, the path to losing a home can be hard to imagine. Many assume homelessness happens as a result of poor decision-making. The truth is far more complex and often comes as a direct result of our flawed, inequitable system.

We recently published an article about the three most common reasons that families experience homelessness. [You can read that here](https://familypromise.org/the-latest/top-causes-family-homelessness/).

At Family Promise, we know that the best way to address family homelessness is by preventing it in the first place. That’s why the focus of this year’s Family Promise Giving Day is raising awareness and fundraising for our prevention programs across the U.S.

Family Promise Giving Day is a 24-hour online campaign to raise awareness and funds to support families across America experiencing homelessness or at-risk of losing their housing. In addition to providing emergency shelter, Family Promise focuses on preventing families from becoming homeless in the first place.

Sponsors of this event include [Clayton](https://www.claytonhomes.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [Belk](https://www.belk.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [Woodforest National Bank](https://www.woodforest.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [TJX](https://www.tjx.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [Synchrony](https://www.synchrony.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [KIA](https://www.kia.com/us/en?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [Progressive](https://www.progressive.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), [Ikea](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay), and [eSalon](https://www.esalon.com/?utm_source=Family%20Promise&utm_medium=Press%20Release&utm_campaign=FamilyPromiseGivingDay). The Family Promise National board of trustees will also be sponsoring two match hours (9-10 AM Eastern and 8-9 PM Eastern) where all gifts to Family Promise National will be doubled up to over $230,000.

“At Family Promise, we believe that a child’s future begins at home,” said Claas Ehlers, CEO of Family Promise. “Preventing a family from becoming homeless is the most effective way to address the crisis of family homelessness.”

Those who wish to help us fight family homelessness by participating in Family Promise Giving Day can visit [FPGives.org](https://www.fpgives.org/) to donate or spread the word on social media by sharing content from Family Promise’s accounts.
