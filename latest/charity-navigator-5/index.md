**Summit, NJ – Sept. 16, 2021 –** Family Promise’s\*\* **strong financial health and commitment to accountability** **and transparency have** **earned it a 4-star rating from [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/521591461), America’s largest independent charity evaluator. This is the 9th** \*\*consecutive time that Family Promise has earned this top distinction, including a perfect score of 100 out of 100 points.

Since 2002, using objective analysis, Charity Navigator has awarded only the most fiscally responsible organizations a 4-star rating. In 2011, Charity Navigator added 17 metrics, focused on governance and ethical practices as well as measures of openness, to its ratings methodology. These Accountability & Transparency metrics, which account for 50 percent of a charity’s overall rating, reveal which charities operate in accordance with industry best practices and whether they are open with their donors and stakeholders.

“Family Promise’s\*\* **exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public,” according to Michael Thatcher, President & CEO of Charity Navigator. “Only a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating. This adds Family Promise to a preeminent group of charities working to overcome our world’s most pressing challenges. Based on its 4-star rating, people can trust that their donations are going to a financially responsible and ethical charity when they decide to support Family Promise.” ** \*\*

“It’s important our donors and partners trust that we’re using their donations wisely to accomplish Family Promise’s mission,” said Family Promise CEO, Claas Ehlers.  “Our 4-star Charity Navigator rating and perfect score demonstrate to our supporters our good governance and financial accountability.”

Family Promise’s rating and other information about charitable giving are [available free of charge](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9926). You can learn more about the impact of your donations to Family Promise [here](../../the-latest/roi/index.html).

**About Family Promise**

Family Promise envisions a nation in which every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future. What began as a local initiative in Summit, NJ, has become a national movement that involves 200,000 volunteers and has served more than 1 million family members since our founding.

Currently, Family Promise is working in over 200 communities in 43 states to prevent family homelessness, and ensure that families have a safe place to call home and the resources they need during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**About Charity Navigator **

Charity Navigator, [www.charitynavigator.org](http://www.charitynavigator.org/), is the largest charity evaluator in America and its website attracts more visitors than all other charity rating groups combined. The organization helps guide intelligent giving by evaluating the Financial Health and Accountability & Transparency of more than 8,000 charities. Charity Navigator accepts no advertising or donations from the organizations it evaluates, ensuring unbiased evaluations, nor does it charge the public for this trusted data. As a result, Charity Navigator, a 501 (c) (3) public charity itself, depends on support from individuals, corporations and foundations that believe it provides a much-needed service to America’s charitable givers. Charity Navigator can be reached directly by telephone at (201) 818-1288, or by mail at 139 Harristown Road, Suite 101, Glen Rock, N.J., 07452.
