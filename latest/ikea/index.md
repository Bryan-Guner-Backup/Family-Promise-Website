## ‘A Place Called Home’ will support stable learning environments for children across the country and help expand homelessness prevention services

**Conshohocken, PA** – To further its existing relief efforts for the many people impacted by COVID-19, IKEA U.S. today announced its new ‘_A Place Called Home_’ initiative to assist homeless populations and promote conducive learning environments in underserved communities. As part of the company’s ongoing commitment to local communities, IKEA U.S. has committed $540,000 total to partners [Family Promise](https://familypromise.org/) and Save the Children via in-kind and monetary donations.

“IKEA believes that home is the most important place in the world. We recognize that now more than ever, many families are in crisis as the pandemic has exacerbated issues facing lower-income students and at-risk and already homeless populations,” said Jennifer Keesson, IKEA U.S. Country Sustainability Manager. “Everyone deserves a place called home, and this initiative aims to further our COVID-19 relief efforts in local communities by supporting homelessness prevention and providing much needed educational supplies and furnishings for children across the country.”

Through its partnership with Family Promise, the leading national nonprofit addressing family homelessness through an intergenerational, community-based response, IKEA will provide:

- Monetary support of $150,000 to help at least 30 Family Promise local Affiliates establish or expand their homelessness prevention and stabilization services. These services work toward keeping families in housing and support them once they have secured housing to ensure they remain independent.
- An additional $150,000 in-kind product donation to be distributed throughout February and March 2021 to support upgrades to their day centers and permanent shelter sites at 10 local Affiliates.

“I could not be more thrilled with our partnership,” said Claas Ehlers, CEO, Family Promise. “IKEA has meant home for generations of families, providing comfort, style, and affordable furnishings that make a house or apartment truly a home. The commitment IKEA has to families at risk of homelessness and our Affiliates who work tirelessly to support them is inspiring.”

To help promote conducive learning environments and alleviate students in need, IKEA will also support Save The Children, a leading humanitarian organization for children, by providing:

- A $200,000 in-kind donation worth of furnishings and supplies that will be distributed in spring 2021 to create fun, stable, at-home learning environments for children in the U.S. to help them keep up with the demands of school.
- An additional $40,000 monetary donation to support staff time, assembly, and distribution of the furnishings and supplies to families. Any additional funds will go towards Save The Children’s U.S. COVID-19 general response fund to adapt classrooms as needed and support families and children with in-home learning.

As a company that cares deeply about people, the ‘A Place Called Home’ initiative is part of ongoing IKEA relief efforts for the many impacted by the pandemic. Between March and August 2020, IKEA led with its values and impacted 1.1+ million people across communities through [$1.9+ million worth of donations](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/this-is-ikea/newsroom/ikea-retail-u-s-donates-more-than-usd1-6-million-in-products-and-supplies-to-support-covid-19-relief-pub7c72f4cd) both nationally and locally, 350+ local donations, and partnerships with Feeding America and American Red Cross.
