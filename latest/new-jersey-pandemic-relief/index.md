## Second Gift from New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund to Family Promise will be distributed to 10 Affiliates Statewide.

**SUMMIT, NJ** — The New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund has provided a grant to Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit working to end family homelessness, in support of efforts to prevent families with children from experiencing homelessness as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic across the state of New Jersey. The $250,000 donation will go towards efforts to directly support families at risk of experiencing homelessness.

“The New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund is proud to support the work of Family Promise, who day in and out are on the frontline of the COVID pandemic to support New Jersey families who need our help the most,” said Josh Weinreich, CEO of the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. “From Elizabeth to Glassboro, to West Creek, and all across the state, Family Promise’s 200,000 volunteers are ensuring that our most vulnerable families have the resources they need to endure this pandemic. It’s another great Jersey helping Jersey story.”

“The COVID-19 Pandemic has highlighted the importance that all families have a place to call home. We know that the best way to end homelessness is by preventing it in the first place,” said Claas Ehlers, CEO of Family Promise. “We are incredibly thankful to the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund for helping us keep children across the state of New Jersey from having to experience the trauma of losing their homes.”

The $250,000 grant will be distributed by Family Promise National to the following Family Promise locations:

- Family Promise of Bergen County, Ridgewood, NJ
- Family Promise of Burlington County, Moorestown, NJ
- Family Promise of Essex County, Montclair, NJ
- Family Promise of Hudson County, Jersey City, NJ
- Family Promise of Hunterdon County, Flemington, NJ
- Family Promise of Morris County, Morristown, NJ
- Family Promise of Southern Ocean County, West Creek, NJ
- Family Promise of Southwest New Jersey, Glassboro, NJ
- Family Promise of Sussex County, Newton, NJ
- Family Promise Union County, Elizabeth, NJ

This is the second gift the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund has made in support of Family Promise’s efforts. [Last year, NJPRF provided $30,000 to Family Promise Union County](https://familypromise.org/the-latest/press-releases/new-jersey-pandemic-relief-fund/), a program of the National Office, to support critical prevention and shelter services during the pandemic.

The New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund provides grants to existing organizations with a demonstrated track record of caring for vulnerable communities. The Fund is hosted by the Community Foundation of New Jersey. Over the past year, NJPRF has funded nearly 500 organizations across the state of New Jersey. The organization has announced grants to an additional 140 organizations that are best positioned to provide services and support to New Jersey communities in greatest need.
