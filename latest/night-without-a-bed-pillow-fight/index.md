Night Without a Bed is coming on June 26th, 2021!

\#NightWithoutABed is a social media challenge that raises awareness for families experiencing homelessness. We ask participants to sleep anywhere without a bed: cars, a tent, a treehouse, living room floor, a couch and use the hashtag \#NightWithoutABed to post a video blog or photo with a short blog entry to describe their experiences. In the run-up to the event, participants will challenge another  
friend to complete the \#NightWithoutABed or make a donation to Family Promise.
