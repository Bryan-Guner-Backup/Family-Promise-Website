Hurricane Ida left a trail of devastation across portions of the country, impacting dozens of Family Promise Affiliates and hundreds of families. We need your support!

Please help now!

Family Promise Affiliates

Family Promise Affiliates and families from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast are reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Ida. Please give now to support families in crisis as they struggle to regain stability in the wake of this storm!

**Donate here:** [**https://donate.familypromise.org/hurricaneida**](https://donate.familypromise.org/hurricaneida)

Family Promise Union County

Union County, NJ, was hit particularly hard by Hurricane Ida. Family Promise’s flagship program, Family Promise Union County, suffered devastating loss – flooding in the day center destroyed office equipment and supplies for families, including the food pantry, and rendered the building unusable. Despite the loss of our day center, FPUC continues to serve families in crisis. Please give now to support the FPUC community impacted by Hurricane Ida!
