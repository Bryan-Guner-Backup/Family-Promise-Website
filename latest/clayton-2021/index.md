**Summit, NJ** – Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit addressing family homelessness, has announced the continuation of their partnership with [Clayton](https://www.claytonhomes.com/clayton-impact/?utm_source=Release&utm_medium=FP&utm_campaign=FP_2021announcement&Source=FP_Release_FP_2021announcement), a national home builder of site-built and off-site built homes. Through the partnership, which launched in November of 2019, Clayton and Family Promise aim to prevent more than 700 families from becoming homeless in 2021, through educational outreach and resource development, comprehensive case management, support services, and non-traditional, affordable housing solutions for graduate families, such as off-site built housing and transitional housing.

The partnership is part of Family Promise’s [_A Future Begins at Home_ program](https://www.claytonhomes.com/newsroom/press-releases/Family-Promise-and-Clayton-Announce-A-Future-Begins-at-Home-Partnership?utm_source=Release&utm_medium=FP&utm_campaign=FP_2021announcement&Source=FP_Release_FP_2021announcement), which focuses on the crucial importance of housing not just on a family’s wellbeing, but a child’s future. The program includes services that prevent families from becoming homeless or divert them from entering shelter, through targeted intervention, including strategic use of funding, comprehensive case management, and community relationship building.

“At Clayton, our goal is to make homeownership more attainable which leads to greater family stability, wealth creation and building a better future,” said Kevin Clayton, CEO of Clayton. “We are proud and fortunate to partner with Family Promise who is so experienced at reducing homelessness and setting families up for success.”

“Since we launched A Future Begins at Home, our partnership with Clayton has helped countless families achieve housing independence through home donations and homelessness prevention efforts,” said Claas Ehlers, CEO of Family Promise National. “We are thankful for Clayton’s ongoing commitment to the fight against family homelessness, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a significant impact on America’s low-income families.”

As part of this year’s partnership, Clayton will provide over $450,000 in support to Family Promise and its Affiliates, as well as three new off-site Clayton Built® homes valued at more than $175,000, to be used as transitional housing.

As part of the monetary support, Clayton and Family Promise National are providing A Future Begins at Home: Prevention and Shelter Diversion Grants to 26 Family Promise Affiliates across the country. The following Affiliates have been named as recipients of these grants:
