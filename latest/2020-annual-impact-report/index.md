**Summit, NJ** —  2020 was a transformative year for Family Promise. Facing a myriad of challenges presented by an unprecedented global pandemic, Family Promise Affiliates across the country adapted to the new landscape, continuing to engage volunteers and serving more families and children than ever before.

[<img src="https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/After-the-Storm2-300x300.jpg" alt="Volunteers" class="size-medium wp-image-45820 alignleft" width="300" height="300" />](https://fp2020air.familypromise.org/)“The pandemic rendered our core communal shelter program nearly impossible, and we increased prevention, diversion, and stabilization services to keep families housed and avoid shelter,” said Claas Ehlers, Family Promise CEO. “Our corporate partners played a crucial role. From product and PPE donations to significant financial support, corporate partners enabled us to introduce several impactful programs to address the immediate and long-term needs of the families and children we serve.”

So many families lost jobs and were at risk of losing their homes. The generosity of corporate partners, including Belk, Beiersdorf, Clayton Homes, Ikea, Kia, Synchrony, and others, allowed Affiliates to increase their work in prevention and shelter diversion. New, innovative programming like A Future Begins at Home, an initiative that helps families in crisis avoid the trauma of homelessness through comprehensive support, and Innovation Grants, which supported the expansion of prevention services helped Affiliates deliver critical services to families during the pandemic, keeping them housed and safe.

[The Annual Impact Report](https://fp2020air.familypromise.org/) showcases Family Promise’s work during the past year. Overall, in 2020, Family Promise Affiliates served 177,474 family members in all programs. By increasing prevention, diversion, and stabilization services, half of Family Promise’s 200 Affiliates doubled the number of individuals served and 28,398 episodes of homelessness were avoided or shortened.
