# Purpose

<span property="itemListElement" typeof="ListItem"><a href="../index.html" class="post post-page" title="Go to Who We Are."><span data-property="name">Who We Are</span></a></span>

## OUR MISSION

Our mission is to help families experiencing homelessness and low-income families achieve sustainable independence through a community-based response.

### TACKLING THE PROBLEM OF POVERTY

Poverty is a complex problem. It won’t yield to a simple solution. It requires an integrated approach that reaches beyond immediate needs.

We initiate coordinated local efforts that bring communities together to help families experiencing homelessness regain their housing, their independence, and their dignity.

Every year in America, over 3 million children experience homelessness. These children are 8-9 times more likely to repeat a grade, 3 times more likely to be placed in special education programs, and 7 times more likely to attempt suicide. 42% will drop out of school at some point and 47% suffer from anxiety, depression, or withdrawal.

### PROVIDING A WAY TO HELP

Americans are a compassionate people. Enormous numbers of people would help their neighbors in need if they had a way to help. We bring people in need together with people who want to help. We provide the framework that turns compassion into action.

### EMPOWERING COMPASSIONATE INDIVIDUALS

The issue can seem overwhelming and individuals may feel powerless to change the lives of people in poverty. As Family Promise volunteers, more than 200,000 people have found a way.

Working together, they provide temporary housing, meals, and services to more than 125,000 family members annually. They mentor families at-risk of experiencing homelessness. They teach financial literacy. They help find jobs and affordable housing. They create programs to meet specific needs in their communities. And they advocate for public policies that alleviate poverty and promote the economic stability of low-income families.

“I never imagined we’d be in this situation, but Family Promise shattered my stereotype of how homelessness is treated. It’s a whole community of people who are there for you in any way you need, even after you get back on your feet.”

<span class="et_pb_testimonial_author">—Family Promise Graduate</span>

## <span style="color: #ffffff;">OUR VISION</span>

Our vision is a nation in which every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future.

### STATEMENT ON EQUALITY AND NON-DISCRIMINATION

Family Promise serves families of all compositions. We welcome everyone in the community to be part of the solution to empower families experiencing homelessness and ultimately retain and regain the safety, security, and opportunity that comes with having a home.

### STATEMENT ON RACISM

It is impossible to separate systemic and structural racism from the reality that people of color, and Black people in particular, are disproportionately affected by homelessness and poverty. Family Promise is committed to being an anti-racist organization. We will educate and engage ourselves, our stakeholders, and the community to work towards overcoming racism, so that race no longer defines who has housing.
