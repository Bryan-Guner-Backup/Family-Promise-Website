### Melissa Biggar

Director of Impact Giving and Communications

### Melissa Biggar

Director of Impact Giving and Communications

Melissa Biggar’s childhood shyness compelled her to hone her writing skills, but once she came out of her shell her family couldn’t shut her up. The result: more than 20 years of communications and client relations experience in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors. With professional interests as eclectic as her iPhone playlist, she has worked in publishing, philanthropic foundations, higher education, and the financial industry. Melissa studied English literature and creative writing at Dickinson College and has participated in several writers’ workshops, including the prestigious Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference in rural Middlebury, VT, where the first chapter to her still-not-published (or written, for that matter) novel was born and where she spent a week without access to a hairdryer, both profound experiences in her adult life.

As Director of Impact Giving and Communications at Family Promise, Melissa does more than count money like a veteran bank teller. She works with a dedicated and talented development and communications team to raise awareness of the crisis of family homelessness and support for families rebuilding their lives. She manages multiple fundraising campaigns, giving societies, and donor communications throughout the year, including Family Promise’s annual appeal and its quarterly newsletter. Her passion for developing innovative, creative, and effective content and her fervent belief in the power of storytelling inform her work, and she [helps Family Promise graduates share their journeys](../../latest/category/voices-of-family-promise/index.html) to demonstrate the transformative and far-reaching impact the organization has on families’ lives while in the program and after.

Melissa was born in New York City, which probably explains her insatiable attraction to The Big Apple, and grew up in New Jersey defying convention by attending only one Bruce Springsteen concert and knowing how to pump her own gas. Most of her writing now involves dollars and sense, but the Great American Novel is hidden somewhere deep inside her waiting for the right time to surface. Melissa loves to travel and has never met a plane ticket she didn’t like. She calls New Jersey home, along with her Puerto Rican rescue dog (who doesn’t speak Spanish or English) and her two American kids (who both speak English but prefer to text).

Her dedication to Family Promise’s mission compelled her to find a way to do even more for families in need.

As Donor Engagement Manager, Corina plans [events that raise awareness of the issue of family homelessness and garner support for families facing a housing crisis](../../events/index.html). She brings her creative design talents, attention to detail, and organizational skills to the task of conceiving, planning, and hosting all of Family Promise’s events, from jacket-and-tie-required galas, art gallery receptions, and theme parties, to bring-the-kids family fun days, staff outings, and more. As she likes to say, “Life’s a party!” Of course, there’s more to Corina’s work than meets the eye – she’s responsible for the fundraising component of every benefit she runs, and she works closely with major donors and high-level corporate sponsors to help secure funds for families facing homelessness. Some of her events have raised record amounts for the organization. All of her events are the ticket to have.

When she’s not working, Family Promise’s hostess with the mostest can be found spending time with her husband Josh, daughters Abbie and Campbell, and three rescue dogs (because two isn’t enough) Coco, Molly, and Wyatt (All three dogs started out as foster pets, so Josh put a temporary stop to the fostering animals thing.) Corina was born in Mexico City and moved to the United States as a child, but she still speaks Spanish when she doesn’t want her husband or children to know what she’s saying.

Growing up in Arizona, Paula Massa took an early interest in cultures and society after observing the exploitation and dismissal of Native Americans and their culture. She attended the University of Colorado for two years, but life presented a detour and she finished with a BA in Anthropology & Behavioral Science at Drew University.

From managing the implementation of marketing projects that included brand awareness and membership retention, to taking a job with a leading nonprofit software provider where she could work with various national nonprofits overseeing their software implementations, her experience in marketing and communications is eclectic, to say the least. Volunteering with various community-driven organizations kept her in touch with social concerns, which eventually motivated her to come full circle and pursue a position with an organization whose [mission](../purpose/index.html) was to help and serve people. Her role as Development Operations Manager allows her to use her experience for a purpose that she feels strongly about and work with a dedicated group of people with a common goal – helping people who need it most.

### Lindsay Moore

Regional Director (Midwest)

Lindsay Moore studied mass media communication, at the University of Michigan-Flint, and spent more than a decade working in television newsrooms, in both Flint and Detroit. Her passion for broadcast media was always fueled, partly, by wanting to know what was happening in the world around her, but mostly by being able to harness the power of media for the greater good of the community. Throughout her time in media, she continued volunteering, including overseeing a meal ministry which led her to discover Family Promise. Working with financially fragile families highlighted the need for a program specifically serving families and research lead to Family Promise. She worked alongside a group of very dedicated individuals, to launch [Family Promise of Genesee County](https://familypromiseofgc.org/). She served on the founding Board of Directors then spent four years committed to the role of the Affiliate’s Executive Director. Her time serving families and growing Affiliate programming was life-changing and led to an opportunity to work directly with the National Family Promise office as an Associate, doing some contract work with other Affiliates.

Beginning in 2017, Lindsay joined the National team as the Midwest Regional Director, a role she absolutely loves! Her favorite part is working with [Affiliate](../../what-we-do/affiliates/locations/index.html) staffs and boards of directors across the Midwest, to continue the amazing work being done in each community and bringing new opportunities for growth and support from the amazing National team. This role brings together her passion for serving people and seeing the power of good grow within communities. She enjoys traveling to the different Day Centers and learning about how each Affiliate serves children and families experiencing homelessness and working with them to deepen community relationships and impact.

She is proud to serve the Midwest region from her home base, in Michigan, where she lives with three amazing humans, her daughters and husband. She continues to volunteer with her family, at Family Promise of Genesee County. She has a ridiculous obsession with office supplies, particularly Sharpies, including some sentimental ones. She loves spending time outdoors and near water; she’s an avid reader and a wanna-be runner and yogi.

### Sara Naparstek

Housing Coordinator, Family Promise Union County

Sara precociously got her start at her local Family Promise when she was in high school. This preceded it being called Family Promise, that branch instead being known as Youth Council for the Homeless of Bergen County. Sara would volunteer at the summer camp for the children in the shelter. From there, she went on to get her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Mount Holyoke College in Western Massachusetts. After that, she lived abroad in South Korea for a year while teaching English. She went with no prior experience studying Korean, nor had she ever even sampled the cuisine (her first meal was on the plane there!). When she got back, she made good use of her Psychology degree by working as a set dresser in New York’s bustling film industry for a number of years. In the last few years, she juggled that alongside pursuing her master’s degree in Social Work from Rutgers Newark. She had the good fortune to intern with Family Promise as her first year internship. She graduated in the middle of the pandemic and feels like it has been a baptism by fire ever since. She is, however, proud to play a role in such an important and necessary organization to those in need.

Communications & Development Intern

Cyan Perdue is a 2021 graduate of Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science in Social Work. She is originally from Newark, NJ, and was offered the opportunity to attend high school at The Madeira School, a boarding school in Northern Virginia. To find comfort in a space that didn’t feel designed for her, she developed a passion for people and creating communities around topics of social justice, equity, and radical self-care. Her introduction to the nonprofit sector began with her senior year internship with a family service agency, The Children’s Consortium in Syracuse, NY. As an intern there, she facilitated parenting classes, conducted research, and assisted with the development of a new co-parenting course. Many families she served came from marginalized and low-income backgrounds and as someone who has not always had access to the services she may have needed, Cyan finds joy in providing that for others.

As she starts her journey with Family Promise, Cyan is continuing her graduate education at Rutgers University, working towards a Master's in social work. Her passion for social justice and creativity combine within her role as a Communications and Development Intern at Family Promise. She spends her time creating creative TikTok content, working on blog content expanding on the relationship between mental health and the experience of homelessness, and helping to expand Family Promises’ social media presence.

In her free time, you will likely find Cyan listening to music, practicing yoga, writing, or hanging out with friends and family.
