### Imagine: A Center for Coping with Loss

### Imagine: A Center for Coping with Loss

Homelessness brings a profound sense of loss and, with it, comes trauma and grief. Recognizing that, our Union County program partnered with Imagine, A Center for Coping with Loss, to develop a “Living With Loss: Healing From Homelessness” workshop to help guests work through that trauma and train volunteers to facilitate the process. The curriculum promotes empathetic learning about the trauma we all experience throughout our journeys, which can lead us to deeper human connections.

The innovative workshop was profiled in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/nyregion/dealing-with-the-grief-that-accompanies-homelessness.html?fbclid=IwAR2n_aqqilm_8EgZ3y7Jdu2t7p3u2ppP15fBSztKZrx7vHpPa7SisvslmSc).

The partnership is now being rolled out to Affiliates and their communities nationwide.
