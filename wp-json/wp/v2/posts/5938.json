These Accountability &amp; Transparency metrics, which account for 50 percent of a charity\u2019s overall rating, reveal which charities operate in accordance with industry best&nbsp;practices and&nbsp;whether they are open with their donors and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFamily Promise\u2019s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public,\u201d according to Michael Thatcher, President &amp; CEO of Charity Navigator. \u201cOnly a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating. This adds&nbsp;Family Promise&nbsp;to a preeminent group of charities working to overcome our world\u2019s most pressing challenges. Based on its 4-star rating, people can trust that their donations are going to a financially responsible and ethical charity when they decide to support&nbsp;Family Promise.\u201d&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s important our donors\u00a0and partners\u00a0trust that we\u2019re using their donations wisely to accomplish\u00a0Family Promise\u2019s mission,\u201d\u00a0said\u00a0Family Promise CEO, Claas Ehlers.\u00a0 \u201cOur 4-star Charity Navigator rating\u00a0and perfect score\u00a0demonstrate to our supporters our good governance and financial accountability.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family Promise\u2019s rating and other information about charitable giving are\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9926\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">available free of charge</a>.\u00a0You can learn more about the impact of your donations to Family Promise\u00a0<a href=\"https://familypromise.org/the-latest/roi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Family Promise</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family Promise envisions a nation in which every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future. What began as a local initiative in Summit, NJ, has become a national movement that involves 200,000 volunteers and&nbsp;has served more than 1 million family members since our founding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Family Promise is working in over 200 communities in 43 states to&nbsp;prevent family&nbsp;homelessness, and&nbsp;ensure that families have a safe place to call home and the resources they need during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Charity Navigator&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charity Navigator,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.charitynavigator.org</a>,\u00a0is the largest charity evaluator in America and its website attracts more visitors than all other charity rating groups combined. The organization helps guide intelligent giving by evaluating the Financial Health and Accountability &amp; Transparency of more than 8,000 charities. Charity Navigator accepts no advertising or donations from the organizations it evaluates, ensuring unbiased evaluations, nor does it charge the public for this trusted data. As a result, Charity Navigator, a 501 (c) (3) public charity itself, depends on support from individuals, corporations and foundations that believe it provides a much-needed service to America\u2019s charitable givers. Charity Navigator can be reached directly by telephone at (201) 818-1288, or by mail at 139 Harristown Road, Suite 101, Glen Rock, N.J., 07452.</p>\n",
