eviction moratorium,&nbsp;just as children are going back to school and the Delta variant is on the rise,&nbsp;is a&nbsp;major blow for&nbsp;families at risk of homelessness.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 6 million households are on the brink of eviction nationally\u00a0due to the pandemic, with government funds not reaching them in time to maintain their housing.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is simply not acceptable.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children who experience homelessness are 87% more likely to drop out of school and high school students are 4.3 times more likely than their peers to attempt suicide.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While several states have enacted their own&nbsp;eviction moratoriums, we call on Congress to authorize a&nbsp;federally imposed, nationwide&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;moratorium.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During these challenging times,&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Promise&nbsp;is&nbsp;committed to preventing families from losing their homes&nbsp;and&nbsp;assuring the continuity of education for children.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&nbsp;are the&nbsp;top five&nbsp;actions we are taking:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>We are working with pro bono&nbsp;law&nbsp;firms across the country to fight wrongful evictions.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We are providing emergency rental assistance and landlord mediation.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We are engaging partners to&nbsp;offer&nbsp;employment&nbsp;support, childcare, and&nbsp;healthcare.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We are&nbsp;raising awareness and engaging volunteers to make a lasting impact.&nbsp;<\/li><li>We
