She has stayed involved in the college community beyond her four years and currently serves on the school\u2019s Alumni Board and Young Alumni Council. Maggie earned her Master of Public Administration, with a concentration in Non-Profit Management, from Rutgers-Newark. Prior to her work at Family Promise, Maggie worked in Volunteer Management at Jersey Cares and then New York Cares, both part of the Points of Light Network. At these organizations, Maggie worked to engage corporate and civic groups in volunteer service and train new volunteer leaders. Working with volunteers showed her the impact that one person can make in their community whether painting a room, tutoring a child, or serving a meal.</p>\n<p>At Family Promise, Maggie serves as Affiliate Services Manager, which means that she sends lots of emails. Joking aside, Maggie ensures that all <a href=%22/what-we-do/affiliates/locations/%22 data-et-target-link=%22_blank%22 rel=%22noopener noreferrer%22>200 Affiliates</a> are engaged and involved with partnerships and resources that National offers. Some of the programs that she manages are Partners in Housing (Manufactured Housing), Pathways to Workplace Success (Workforce Development Videos), Keys to Good Tenancy, and Family Mentoring. She also works with Affiliates to ensure they have the resources and support to meet all standards of Affiliation, such as completing the Annual Census.</p>\n<p>In her spare time, you can find Maggie making nerdy crafts, baking cookies, learning about retro video games from her husband, and listening to True Crime podcasts.</p>\n<p>ext. 113</p>\n<p>&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.10&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][/et_pb_fp_person][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_fp_person name=&#8221;Melissa Biggar&#8221; title=&#8221;Director of Impact Giving and Communications&#8221; image_url=&#8221;https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/melissa-biggar.jpg&#8221; modal_content=&#8221;</p>\n<p>Melissa Biggar\u2019s childhood shyness compelled her to hone her writing skills, but once she came out of her shell her family couldn\u2019t shut her up. The result: more than 20 years of communications and client relations experience in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors. With professional interests as eclectic as her iPhone playlist, she has worked in publishing, philanthropic foundations, higher education, and the financial industry. Melissa studied English literature and creative writing at Dickinson College and has participated in several writers\u2019 workshops, including the prestigious Bread Loaf Writers\u2019 Conference in rural Middlebury, VT, where the first chapter to her still-not-published (or written, for that matter) novel was born and where she spent a week without access to a hairdryer, both profound experiences in her adult life.</p>\n<p>As Director of Impact Giving and Communications at Family Promise, Melissa does more than count money like a veteran bank teller. She works with a dedicated and talented development and communications team to raise awareness of the crisis of family homelessness and support for families rebuilding their lives. She manages multiple fundraising campaigns, giving societies, and donor communications throughout the year, including Family Promise\u2019s annual appeal and its quarterly newsletter. Her passion for developing innovative, creative, and effective content and her fervent belief in the power of storytelling inform her work, and she <a href=%22/latest/category/voices-of-family-promise/%22 data-et-target-link=%22_blank%22 rel=%22noopener noreferrer%22>helps Family Promise graduates share their journeys</a> to demonstrate the transformative and far-reaching impact the organization has on families\u2019 lives while in the program and after.</p>\n<p>Melissa was born in New York City, which probably explains her insatiable attraction to The Big Apple, and grew up in New Jersey defying convention by attending only one Bruce Springsteen concert and knowing how to pump her own gas. Most of her writing now involves dollars and sense, but the Great American Novel is hidden somewhere deep inside her waiting for the right time to surface. Melissa loves to travel and has never met a plane ticket she didn\u2019t like. She calls New Jersey home, along with her Puerto Rican rescue dog (who doesn\u2019t speak Spanish or English) and her two American kids (who both speak English but prefer to text).</p>\n<p>ext. 121</p>\n<p>&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.4&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][/et_pb_fp_person][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.9.2&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_fp_person name=&#8221;Corina Borg&#8221; title=&#8221;Donor Engagement Manager&#8221; image_url=&#8221;https://familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Corina-Borg.jpg&#8221; modal_content=&#8221;</p>\n<p>After graduating from Pepperdine University Corina Borg moved to NYC to start her career.

Her passion for broadcast media was always fueled, partly, by wanting to know what was happening in the world around her, but mostly by being able to harness the power of media for the greater good of the community. Throughout her time in media, she continued volunteering, including overseeing a meal ministry which led her to discover Family Promise. Working with financially fragile families highlighted the need for a program specifically serving families and research lead to Family Promise.

Her favorite part is working with <a href=%22/what-we-do/affiliates/locations/%22 data-et-target-link=%22_blank%22 rel=%22noopener%22>Affiliate</a> staffs and boards of directors across the Midwest, to continue the amazing work being done in each community and bringing new opportunities for growth and support from the amazing National team. This role brings together her passion for serving people and seeing the power of good grow within communities. She enjoys traveling to the different Day Centers and learning about how each Affiliate serves children and families experiencing homelessness and working with them to deepen community relationships and impact.</p>\n<p>She is proud to serve the Midwest region from her home base, in Michigan, where she lives with three amazing humans, her daughters and husband. She continues to volunteer with her family, at Family Promise of Genesee County. She has a ridiculous obsession with office supplies, particularly Sharpies, including some sentimental ones.

After that, she lived abroad in South Korea for a year while teaching English.
