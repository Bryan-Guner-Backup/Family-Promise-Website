### WHO WE ARE

Family Promise envisions a nation in which every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future. What began as a local initiative in Summit, NJ, has become a national movement that involves 200,000 volunteers in 200+ communities in 43 states. Our volunteers provide hospitality, companionship, and most importantly, community.

### WHY WE DO IT

There is a severe shortage of affordable housing in America, exacerbated by rising rents and stagnant wages. With little or no safety net, one unforeseen expense or emergency can lead to family homelessness. We envision a nation where every family has a home, a livelihood, and the chance to build a better future.
