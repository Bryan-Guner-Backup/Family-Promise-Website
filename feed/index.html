										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Much has been written about the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fopinion%2Ftodaysdebate%2F2021%2F09%2F09%2Fhousing-crisis-protect-renters-eviction%2F5733226001%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slow rollout</a>&nbsp;of the $46.5 billion in Emergency Rental Assistance funding allocated by Congress to support tenants and landlords. The Treasury Department recently reported that states and localities have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/25/us/politics/eviction-rental-assistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distributed just 11%</a>&nbsp;of the existing funds. Pressure to speed up the rollout increased when the Supreme Court&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/us/eviction-moratorium-ends.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended the national eviction moratorium</a>&nbsp;in late August. While some states have their own&nbsp;moratoria, millions of families across the country are at risk of eviction and have yet to receive the funding allocated to support them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effectively distributing rental assistance requires smart and dedicated individuals who&nbsp;will&nbsp;work&nbsp;alongside families&nbsp;while they&nbsp;navigate clunky administrative systems and state policies.&nbsp;Alexis Young, case manager at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.familypromiseorangecounty.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Promise of Orange County, CA,</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;one&nbsp;of those individuals.&nbsp;To&nbsp;help families access&nbsp;these&nbsp;funds,&nbsp;Young&nbsp;assists them while they&nbsp;collect documentation,&nbsp;fill out paperwork,&nbsp;and find stability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When her community went into lockdown in&nbsp;the Spring&nbsp;of&nbsp;2020, Young noticed that many families who had previously received services from Family Promise began to reach out to ask for help with rental assistance. “They lost their jobs,” says Young, “and they were behind on rent.”&nbsp;Young’s team jumped on those requests for&nbsp;assistance,&nbsp;using Zoom or phone calls for case management and encouraging families to&nbsp;apply for the available&nbsp;assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some reached out proactively, many families were not aware of the&nbsp;emergency rental assistance. Others&nbsp;were afraid to ask for help. “Certain factors make people more likely to wait until things get really bad before calling us or asking for help,” says Young. “They think they are supposed to do it alone.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In one week,&nbsp;Young went from&nbsp;helping 8 families at a time to 18. Each case is unique, so Young meets with each family for multiple hours a week to fill out the required paperwork, which can range between 60 and 100 pages. The most common thing that holds a family back from receiving assistance are missing documents. &#8220;When a family applies for rental assistance, it&#8217;s always a lot of work,&#8221; says Young. &#8220;Applications wants social security cards and birth certificates for the entire family, pay stubs, proof of income, and many families do not have all of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Such burdensome requirements are a challenge for most families, but for families who have experienced homelessness,&nbsp;the paperwork&nbsp;is especially&nbsp;taxing. “When you move from one place to another, you lose things. Things are stolen,” says Young.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of&nbsp;tracking down documents and&nbsp;Zoom case management, Young has learned the value of active listening when a family calls. “When a family reaches out, they have been through a lot already. It’s my job to listen, to reflect on what they tell me, to provide as many options as possible, and to let clients choose what best suits them moving forward. I try to ensure families have the opportunity to pick what will best work in their life.” And for her, the&nbsp;work is personal. “I always tell families that I lived homelessness, and I have been there. But to be homeless with children is another challenge. To be homeless with children during a pandemic is another level all together.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting families and landlords the allocated funding is a prerequisite to&nbsp;keeping&nbsp;them&nbsp;safe in their homes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/31/with-national-eviction-ban-over-how-to-apply-for-rental-assistance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advocacy groups</a>, alongside Family Promise, continue to push for&nbsp;process improvements, and&nbsp;certain&nbsp;legislators have&nbsp;attempted to eliminate the funding&#8217;s barriers. On September 8, Representative Maxine Waters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr5196?utm_campaign=govtrack_email_update&amp;utm_source=govtrack/email_update&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced legislation</a>&nbsp;to expand and expedite the help to renters and landlords under the emergency program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the burdensome requirements and slow system,&nbsp;Young is proud of the impact her team has had in Orange County. “I looked at our numbers served and saw that, while so many people had lost their jobs and&nbsp;had&nbsp;hours&nbsp;cut, not one family we served&nbsp;has so far&nbsp;slipped into homelessness. That amazed me.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Family Promise&#8217;s role as a leader in the fight against family homelessness continues to grow as organizations and individuals increasingly turn to Family Promise as a respected authority on this crisis. </p>



<p>Recently, Family Promise CEO Claas Ehlers was invited to serve a second three-year term on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s Community Advisory Group (CAG). A private-sector group comprised of leaders of philanthropic foundations and nonprofit and community development organizations from the region, the CAG provides the New York Fed a view of the issues faced by a diverse set of communities within its district. CAG members are selected based on their experience and expertise, as well as their ability to represent specific communities, such as youth, senior citizens, low-income families, immigrants, veterans, and rural populations.</p>



<p>Says Ehlers, &#8220;Serving on the CAG has been enlightening, seeing the interconnection between monetary policy, employment, and the health of our economy. It has been meaningful to see the New York Fed&#8217;s commitment to address core issues of inequality and disenfranchisement and to lend my expertise on homelessness in the region. I am thrilled to be reappointed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Family Promise&#8217;s influence in the poverty and housing sector has also spurred expansion in the organization&#8217;s own leadership. Family Promise recently welcomed two new members to the board of trustees.</p>



<p>Dr. Victor Aloyo, Jr., is the associate dean of institutional diversity and community engagement at Princeton Theological Seminary where he serves as chief strategist on matters related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. He is also senior pastor of La Iglesia Presbiteriana Nuevas Fronteras in North Plainfield, NJ, and holds leadership roles with a variety of social service and philanthropic organizations. Dr. Aloyo brings more than 30 years of community engagement, multicultural relations, and congregational leadership experience to Family Promise.</p>



<p>Omar Minaya is the former general manager of the New York Mets and the Montreal Expos and now serves as a team ambassador for the Mets with a special focus on outreach to the Latino community. Born in the Dominican Republic, Minaya has been involved in microfinance work there, working with Esperanza International, a Santo Domingo-headquartered charity whose mission is to free children and their families from poverty through initiatives that generate income, education, and health. Minaya was appointed to the President&#8217;s Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition under President George W. Bush.</p>



<p>Family Promise Board of Trustees Chair Leah Griffith is excited about the experience and knowledge Aloyo and Minaya bring to the board and looks forward to working with them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Victor and Omar are dedicated to serving under-represented communities, and their values align with Family Promise&#8217;s mission to ensure all families have access to the resources and opportunities to create a stable, healthy home,&#8221; says Griffith. &#8220;Both have been influential in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in their respective fields, and Family Promise will benefit from their expertise and insight as we work to further our own work in this area.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Summit, NJ – Sept. 16, 2021 –</strong> Family Promise’s<strong> </strong>strong financial health and commitment to accountability<strong> </strong>and transparency have<strong> </strong>earned it a 4-star rating from <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/521591461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charity Navigator</a>, America’s largest independent charity evaluator. This is the 9th<strong> </strong>consecutive time that Family Promise has earned this top distinction, including a perfect score of 100 out of 100 points.</p>



<p>Since 2002, using objective analysis, Charity Navigator has awarded only the most fiscally responsible organizations a 4-star rating.&nbsp;In 2011, Charity Navigator added 17 metrics, focused on governance and ethical practices as well as measures of openness, to its ratings methodology. These Accountability &amp; Transparency metrics, which account for 50 percent of a charity’s overall rating, reveal which charities operate in accordance with industry best&nbsp;practices and&nbsp;whether they are open with their donors and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Family Promise’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public,” according to Michael Thatcher, President &amp; CEO of Charity Navigator. “Only a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating. This adds&nbsp;Family Promise&nbsp;to a preeminent group of charities working to overcome our world’s most pressing challenges. Based on its 4-star rating, people can trust that their donations are going to a financially responsible and ethical charity when they decide to support&nbsp;Family Promise.”&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s important our donors and partners trust that we’re using their donations wisely to accomplish Family Promise’s mission,” said Family Promise CEO, Claas Ehlers.  “Our 4-star Charity Navigator rating and perfect score demonstrate to our supporters our good governance and financial accountability.” </p>

<h2>Corporate Partners &amp; Supporters Help Change Lives</h2>



<p>Summit, NJ &#8211; 2020 was a transformative year for Family Promise.&nbsp; Facing a myriad of challenges presented by an unprecedented global pandemic, Family Promise Affiliates across the country adapted to the new landscape, continuing to engage volunteers, and serving more families and children than ever before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pandemic rendered our core communal shelter program nearly impossible, and we increased prevention, diversion, and stabilization services to keep families housed and avoid shelter,” said Claas Ehlers, Family Promise CEO.&nbsp; “Our corporate partners and supporters played a critical role, enabling us to introduce several impactful programs to address the immediate and long-term needs of the families and children we serve.”</p>



<p>So many families lost jobs and were at risk of losing their homes.&nbsp; Family Promise Affiliates increased their work in prevention and shelter diversion.&nbsp; New, innovative programming like <em>A Future Begins at Home</em>, an initiative that helps families in crisis avoid the trauma of homelessness through comprehensive support, and Innovation Grants, which supported the expansion of prevention services helped Affiliates deliver critical services to families during the pandemic, keeping them housed and safe.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fp2020air.familypromise.org/">Annual Impact Report</a> showcases Family Promise’s work during the past year.&nbsp; Overall, in 2020, Family Promise Affiliates served 177,474 family members in all programs.&nbsp; By increasing prevention, diversion, and stabilization services, half of Family Promise’s 200 Affiliates doubled the number of individuals served and 28,398 episodes of homelessness were avoided or shortened.</p>



<p>This work was made possible with the help of our corporate partners and supporters including:</p>



<ul><li>Beiersdorf: “One of Beiersdorf’s core values is care and we are committed to care beyond skin, beyond our core business. In 2020 we all needed more care than ever before,” said Alvaro Alonso, General Manager Beiersdorf Inc. “As part of Beiersdorf’s COVID relief efforts we were able to give a donation to Family Promise. We’re so pleased to be able to help so many when there’s such a large need, particularly this past year. This is how we live up our purpose CARE BEYOND SKIN.”</li><li>Belk: “Since our founding over 130 years ago, Belk has had a long legacy of supporting our community,” said Nir Patel, CEO of Belk. “With so many people who were impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic over this last year, we knew that we wanted to continue helping as many families as we could. Our partnership with Family Promise has allowed us to help countless families get the support they needed during these trying times so that everyone can have access to a safe place to call home.”</li><li>Clayton: “We are proud to partner with Family Promise to create innovative homelessness prevention programs that help families achieve housing stability,&#8221; said Kevin Clayton, CEO of Clayton. “This partnership supports Clayton&#8217;s vision to develop housing innovations that improve lives and build a better tomorrow.”</li><li>Ikea U.S.: “IKEA believes that home is the most important place in the world. We recognize that now more than ever, many families are in crisis as the pandemic has exacerbated issues facing at-risk and already homeless populations,” said Jennifer Keesson, IKEA U.S. Country Sustainability Manager. “We are honored to work with Family Promise and are happy to see that the monetary and in-kind support we’re providing is helping local communities across the country, particularly in the areas that our stores serve.”</li><li>KIA America, Inc.: “Giving back in meaningful ways is a key component of Kia’s corporate culture and we are humbled to be able to provide assistance to organizations that serve families and children experiencing or at risk for homelessness,” said Russell Wager, vice president, marketing, Kia America, Inc. “The support provided by Family Promise – especially on the health, social, and emotional levels – is critical, and we are grateful for their dedication to these issues.”</li><li>Kiddie Academy: “Safe and stable environments are essential to nurturing a healthy childhood. We are incredibly energized by Family Promise’s critical work and humbled to support a solution that can help children reach their full potential,” shared Kiddie Academy President Joshua Frick.</li><li>Saks OFF 5TH: “At Saks OFF 5TH we have committed to establishing ongoing, long-term charitable partnerships with organizations that directly benefit and impact the communities we serve,” said Paige Thomas, President &amp; CEO, Saks OFF 5TH. “We’re proud to have supported Family Promise through several customer-facing programs in 2020, including much-needed coat and mask donations, and have continued our important work together in 2021.</li><li>Woodforest National Bank: “We are honored to have such a long-standing relationship with Family Promise and its Affiliates to support their mission to keep families housed and avoid shelters. We started our friendship with an awarding-winning program ‘New Beginnings’, our financial education curriculum which gives thousands of people greater financial capability and trusted guidance. We are also excited to develop micro-entrepreneurship resources and tools to help guests achieve greater financial freedom,” said Doug Schaeffer, EVP, CRA Executive Director, Woodforest National Bank.</li></ul>



<p>“We are most grateful for these partners’ extraordinary support,” said Cara Bradshaw, Family Promise Chief Impact Officer.&nbsp; “In addition to helping more families and children remain sustainably housed, our partnerships help to ensure that every child has access to a brighter future.</p>

<p>Nothing sounds as positive as the word “yes.” Unless you’re talking to families at <a href="https://fortbendfamilypromise.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fort Bend Family Promise</a> in Missouri City, TX, where “YEP!” is an even more affirmative word. The Affiliate’s <em>Youth Empowerment Planning</em> program, better known as <em>YEP!,</em> strives to minimize the impact of homelessness on kids. </p>



<p>“<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;is the base of our&nbsp;overall&nbsp;program,” explains Etta Vincent, the Affiliate’s associate director. “We want to ensure as little disruption as possible for children whose families are facing homelessness.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Started in 2011&nbsp;and named by youth in the program at that time,&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;is an everyday&nbsp;component of&nbsp;each&nbsp;family’s case management. Need to register for school transportation?&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;Healthcare guidance for kids?&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;Academic support?&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;Haircuts, new clothing, extracurricular activities,&nbsp;childcare,&nbsp;celebrations…you name it, if it has to do with kids,&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;has it covered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take bedtime. Through&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;its&nbsp;“Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep”&nbsp;initiative, younger children&nbsp;entering&nbsp;the program receive a&nbsp;“Cuddly Kit”&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;a&nbsp;blanket, stuffed animal,&nbsp;and&nbsp;storybook,&nbsp;as well as pajamas donated through a&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;with Carter’s children’s clothing brand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We do a big celebration for high school graduations, too,” says Vincent, describing a&nbsp;mini ceremony&nbsp;where students&nbsp;receive an engraved plaque and a monetary gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Affiliate’s property features&nbsp;“<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;Land,”&nbsp;a garden and outdoor play space at the day center that includes a pond&nbsp;and&nbsp;bridge,&nbsp;play equipment,&nbsp;and a basketball court.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact,&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>’s Ankle Breakers youth basketball team, coached by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Affiliate’s&nbsp;executive&nbsp;director and comprised of kids ages 13-17 from Family Promise families and the Affiliate’s support community,&nbsp;is&nbsp;a popular part of the program. Boys’ and girls’ teams compete annually in the South Texas Championship&nbsp;youth&nbsp;basketball league.&nbsp;In&nbsp;2019, they won the&nbsp;championship&nbsp;and were recognized at the San Antonio Spurs’ opening game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It sounds like fun and games, but&nbsp;<em>YEP!</em>&nbsp;has a serious mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Says Vincent, “Lots of times, when families come to us, their kids aren’t able to participate in extracurricular activities,&nbsp;or they don’t know how to get involved. We don’t want families experiencing homelessness to have to choose between paying rent and utilities or buying football equipment and paying club fees. Kids shouldn’t be deprived of those kinds of activities.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our focus is on the youth,” she adds. “We want to lift them up and empower them, let them know everything will be ok.” </p>

<p class="has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#472d5b;color:#eeeaed">One unexpected benefit of Fort Bend Family Promise’s YEP! program has been an increased awareness of the crisis of family homelessness. When COVID curtailed team sports in 2020, YEP! Ankle Breakers team members decided to research the impact of the pandemic on homeless and housed youth in their community to help assess what types of support are needed for young people whose families were battling homelessness. They were surprised to learn that youth in stable housing situations reported feeling more depressed than those at Family Promise. One theory they developed was that the youth at Family Promise had already experienced significant life changes, possibly increasing their resilience to stress. The group is now looking to publish a paper on this research. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZ6b5PL5e-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Learn more about this project here</a>.</p>

<p>Most employees at <a href="https://www.familypromisepalouse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Promise of the Palouse</a> in Moscow, ID, sit at a desk. But one staff member, Kevin, requires a bed. Kevin is full of compassion for families in crisis and loves his job, but inevitably he likes to lie down and get some shut-eye. It’s all in a day’s work for him as the Affiliate’s therapy dog. </p>



<p>“Kevin is a calming presence to everyone,” says Executive Director Janine Rivera. “He picks up on when families are uneasy or under stress and automatically goes to them. If kids are nervous, he just lies down quietly until they warm up to him. And they always do!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;Newfoundland&nbsp;belongs to&nbsp;Case Manager&nbsp;Rebecca Ryan, who brings&nbsp;him&nbsp;with her to work each day and includes him in family meetings.&nbsp;Rebecca has worked at Family Promise for about two years and started bringing Kevin to work a year ago. She has noticed a change in the way families&nbsp;open up&nbsp;since Kevin entered the picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When families come to us, they’re usually in a state of anxiety and stress,” she says. “When Kevin’s here, they’re immediately drawn to him, and him to them.&nbsp;He’s an icebreaker, a bridge to ease the transition. And if anyone gets upset, he’s always right there to comfort them.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cook family can attest to Kevin’s dedicated work ethic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We met Kevin&nbsp;on&nbsp;our very first day,” recalls Nathan, who came to Family Promise with his children Aidan and&nbsp;Kalina&nbsp;this past summer. “He’s big and friendly and helps make it comfortable for people to be here.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The family is in the shelter program as they work with Family Promise to find housing. Nathan, who was injured on the job and is currently on disability, says Family Promise has also helped him with some car repairs to ensure the family has reliable transportation. He appreciates the supportive environment of Family Promise, including the time his family gets to spend with Kevin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Kalina’s&nbsp;especially close to him,” Nathan says. “She even started a little dog treat business because of Kevin.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kevin loved the special treats Kalina used to bring him from the local farmer&#8217;s market, and she got the idea to make her own. The biscuits were a hit, and she soon began selling them. </p>



<p>“Everybody’s close to Kevin,”&nbsp;Kalina&nbsp;says. “We just pet him, and he exchanges slobber for love and treats!”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kevin was also one of the first staffers Alyssa and her seven-month-old met when they came to Family Promise last spring. The family was preparing to move into a new apartment when unexpected delays pushed back their move-in date, and Family Promise provided temporary&nbsp;shelter until their move later in the summer. While there, Alyssa worked with Family Promise to get her COVID vaccine, find daycare for her son, and&nbsp;formulate&nbsp;a parenting plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alyssa has anxiety issues and says she can get overwhelmed quickly. She has a cat that serves as an emotional support animal, but her brother is caring for it until the family moves into their apartment. In the meantime, Kevin serves as a great source of comfort for her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I love Kevin!”&nbsp;she&nbsp;says. “He’s really gentle and a calming presence during meetings.&nbsp;He’ll notice if I’m starting to get upset and just put his head under my hand so I can pet him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cooks and Alyssa say being at Family Promise is a lot of hard work, but, as Nathan puts it,&nbsp;“Family Promise is there to make sure you succeed.” And if there’s a dog like Kevin to pet and play with along the way, the families agree, the journey is a little easier to&nbsp;manage.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Eight years ago, passionate young volunteers formed the Family Promise Club of Summit High School in Summit, NJ.</p>



<p>Although in the middle of a pandemic, Josh Sacks, President of the Family Promise Club at the Summit High School, was determined to keep the mission invigorated. He brought in over 100 members in just one year.</p>



<p>“I had volunteered with Family Promise since I was in fourth grade, and after my freshman year of being a member in the club, I reached out to Ms. Hernandez [club advisor] to see if I could build a new leadership team and gain more members,” said Sacks.</p>



<p>From there, Sacks recruited a core team of ten motivated students passionate about Family Promise. This allowed new creative ideas such as  Zoom one-on-one tutoring for the kids involved in<a href="https://familypromise.org/what-we-do/fp-union-county/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Family Promise Union County</a>&#8216;s program.</p>



<p>This non-mandatory tutoring program takes place every Tuesday night. Sacks and his team are provided with the number of kids that will be attending on Tuesday the night before and ensure they have an equal number of tutors available. The skilled tutors help the kids with homework they are assigned across a variety of subjects like math, English, and science.</p>



<p>On top of helping kids with their schoolwork, the Summit High School students plan other fun activities for them to enjoy.</p>



<p>“When they are done with their homework, we have extra activities we do with them, like spelling games. We also have special tutoring days that are solely activity days where we mail the arts and crafts supplies so the kids have what they need for the night we plan on making them,” Sacks said.</p>



<p>Another successful event that Sacks and his team engineered was a Venmo Fundraiser that raised over $500. All the money collected was used to buy gift cards for the Family Promise kids over the holiday season.</p>



<p>Even during COVID-19, the Family Promise Club was able to evolve with virtual events that Sacks says “have helped increase attendance at meetings.” The club&#8217;s virtual Giving Tuesday event raised over $2,000. </p>



<p>“I hope we can have a hybrid of virtual and in-person events since our virtual events have been so successful, especially the tutoring. We know volunteering is a big aspect of our club and we want to see the kids in person and play with them more,” Sacks said.</p>



<p>Sacks and his team have much more in store next year as they hope to send more holiday and birthday cards to kids and sell Family Promise lanyards at the start of the school year to raise awareness and funds for Family Promise. </p>

<p>The news that the Supreme Court overturned the COVID-related eviction moratorium,&nbsp;just as children are going back to school and the Delta variant is on the rise,&nbsp;is a&nbsp;major blow for&nbsp;families at risk of homelessness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More than 6 million households are on the brink of eviction nationally due to the pandemic, with government funds not reaching them in time to maintain their housing. </p>



<p>This is simply not acceptable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Children who experience homelessness are 87% more likely to drop out of school and high school students are 4.3 times more likely than their peers to attempt suicide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While several states have enacted their own&nbsp;eviction moratoriums, we call on Congress to authorize a&nbsp;federally imposed, nationwide&nbsp;eviction&nbsp;moratorium.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During these challenging times,&nbsp;Family&nbsp;Promise&nbsp;is&nbsp;committed to preventing families from losing their homes&nbsp;and&nbsp;assuring the continuity of education for children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&nbsp;are the&nbsp;top five&nbsp;actions we are taking:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>We are working with pro bono&nbsp;law&nbsp;firms across the country to fight wrongful evictions.&nbsp;</li><li>We are providing emergency rental assistance and landlord mediation.&nbsp;</li><li>We are engaging partners to&nbsp;offer&nbsp;employment&nbsp;support, childcare, and&nbsp;healthcare.&nbsp;</li><li>We are&nbsp;raising awareness and engaging volunteers to make a lasting impact.&nbsp;</li><li>We are&nbsp;supporting policies that&nbsp;protect&nbsp;low-income&nbsp;families.&nbsp;</li></ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shari Jones gets an early start to her workday. As the program director for <a href="https://www.familypromisegvl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Promise of Gainesville (FPG)</a>, FL, her to-do list can be extensive. First, she will create trauma-informed training for volunteers and staff to better understand child protective factors and to know when to call the Department of Children and Families. Next, Jones will wrap up monthly grant reporting, pulling rental assistance numbers and housing outcome percentages. After, she will create gift baskets to thank five landlords who did not raise their rent during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to work with FPG. Jones will also send notes to a few landlords whose support she hopes to cultivate.</p>



<p>The phone rings throughout the day. Jones is the point of contact for the area’s childcare vouchers distributed through the Continuum of Care (COC), so she is the first person to respond when community partners call with family referrals, or a person calls to directly ask for help. Each day brings a new challenge.</p>



<p>Today, Jones is advocating for a woman who was recently diagnosed with cancer. Just a few days after her diagnosis, her landlord informed the client that he had sold the building and she would need to move out within 30 days. According to Jones, the woman has a housing voucher for $800/month, but there are no units available at that price. Jones plans to call the local housing authority to increase the client’s monthly stipend.</p>



<p>Before starting with the Affiliate as a case manager, Jones had worked across the social services sector: with the county sheriff, the Department of Children and Families, and veterans experiencing homelessness. Since beginning her career, Jones observed the lack of resources for housing insecure families, compared to what appeared to be abundant resources for veterans experiencing homelessness. Jones wanted to work with families. Five years ago, she met the Affiliate’s executive director, Jayne Moraski, at a local COC meeting. The two clicked, and Jones joined Family Promise.</p>



<p>It was immediately clear that Family Promise was a flexible organization, both in the ways it could serve families and how it allowed staff to take care of themselves. Whereas in previous work she worked with 50 families a week, her caseload at FPG is five families. “Our smaller caseload allows us to tailor our programs and services to the people we serve,” says Jones.</p>



<p>To dive deep into a family’s circumstances can take some time. With a smaller caseload, Jones can stay a little longer in each visit, and she has noticed that a longer session can lead to strong connections between staff and families. “It isn’t formulaic, and we treat families holistically,” she reflects. “Our team tries to figure out what an individual family needs, and tailor the programs. It makes the programming and services more effective.”</p>



<p>Holistic case management requires understanding everything a family brings to the table, and how they got to the table to begin with. Jones works to examine situations from a trauma-informed lens and to extend the framework to her staff and volunteers. One topic of discussion is anger. “When someone is angry, we can’t take it personally. Someone’s anger towards you does not mean they don’t like you. We don’t know what they have already experienced, and we don’t know what triggered them to feel angry.”</p>



<p>When talking about trauma and anger with volunteers, Jones uses a metaphor of a boiling pot. “Imagine a parent is in our shelter and has applied to four jobs already, only to be rejected. They have just been notified that their fifth application was not successful. The heat was already turned up on the pot, and it was about to boil. You come into the room to announce that dinner is ready. They lash out at you. That anger is not at you. That is at their situation.” In those moments, according to Jones, it is important to give someone space and to not hold previous interactions against them.</p>



<p>For Jones, the care that staff gives to families makes an internal difference, as well. “I believe that the reason I am so effective at my job is because of the support and flexibility at Family Promise,” she says. “When you deal with people experiencing trauma, you can’t be expected to run around and go back-to-back to meetings. To do good work, I need to decompress, to take stock of how I’m feeling, and to take care of myself.” One of her preferred post-work routines is to make a cup of tea (usually black or apple cinnamon, and always hot despite the Florida summer), to sit in a dark room, and to listen to white noise for a few minutes. This practice helps Jones clear her mind.</p>



<p>Quiet moments are necessary given that working with families in crisis is a difficult job, made more stressful during the pandemic. “Most of the time people think you have to be strict and guarded to be a successful case manager,” she says. “To me, it’s the opposite. If I can show myself grace, I can show grace to others. My team and I truly care about each other. We are open books, and that warmth extends to the families we work with, the team members I manage, and how we treat ourselves.”</p>



<p>Jones had an 8-month-old son when she began at Family Promise, and now the six-year-old comes to work with her a few days each month. “Family Promise is like a second home to him,” says Jones. “If I can take care of my family, I can better serve the families in my community.”</p>
