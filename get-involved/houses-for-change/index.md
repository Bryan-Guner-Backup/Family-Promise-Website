## Innovative Art Project to Help Families Experiencing Homelessness

Houses for Change is a fun, educational art project to raise awareness of homelessness and raise funds for Family Promise, the nation’s leading nonprofit helping families experiencing homelessness.

Using art supplies, children decorate pre-ordered house-shaped cardboard boxes to look like a house. Participants take their boxes home and in the following weeks fill them with change. On a selected date, families bring their filled boxes back to the organization that arranged the project for a communal donation to Family Promise.

More than 50,000 kids have raised more than $500,000 for charities of their choice in the Houses for Change collection boxes they created.

### HOW IT WORKS

**_Materials Needed_**

Provide crayons, markers, glitter, collage materials, scissors, glue sticks, and other arts and crafts materials to decorate the boxes.

**_Teachable Opportunity_**Houses for Change provides an opportunity to teach participants about homelessness and how the money they save in their boxes will help families experiencing homelessness.

**_Communication_**The key to a successful **Houses for Change** project is to inform and engage participants and their parents. Include a letter to parents explaining the project, how the boxes are to be used, about Family Promise, and when the money saved will be collected.

### FAQs

**_Where do I buy the boxes?_**  
The inexpensive undecorated cardboard house-shaped boxes are sold at the [online store](http://family-promise-store.myshopify.com/collections/houses-for-change-project) in two quantities: 25 boxes and 100 boxes. This is the only expense you incur to organize the project.

**_How far in advance should I order my boxes?_**  
Boxes are shipped via UPS from Maine. Allow at least five working days for delivery.

**_How can I organize a Houses for Change Project?  
_**There are two ways to organize a Houses for Change collection box project.

- Have children make their own boxes and take them home to fill with money.
- Have children make boxes that are placed at local businesses to have customers and employees fill with money.

**_What are some tips for a successful Houses for Change project?  
_**The key to a successful project is to communicate effectively to everyone involved.

- If children are to take their boxes home, make sure participants *and* parents understand the purpose of the decorated boxes, the specific charity that will benefit from the money saved, and the date the money will be collected. If appropriate, have a speaker from the charity talk to participants about how the money they collect will make a difference in the lives of those assisted by the charity.  Edit and email the draft [sample letter](http://www.familypromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/SampleProjectLetter1-3-15.pdf) to parents explaining the project so their children will make it a habit to fill their boxes.

<!-- -->

- If the boxes are to be placed at local businesses, prepare a press release, poster and email to inform the community, customers and employees about the purpose of the decorated boxes on display at participating businesses.

### ABOUT HOUSES FOR CHANGE®

Houses for Change was created by long-time Family Promise volunteer Mark Wasserman to engage youth in the issue of family homelessness and to teach kids the values of compassion, charity, and saving–values that will last them a lifetime.

Houses for Change has universal appeal. It has been adopted by families, schools, congregations, Vacation Bible Schools, homeless organizations, the United Way, and the YMCA to engage their youth in a meaningful service project. The project can be used in schools for collection boxes, at community service days, and children’s parties as piggy banks; at churches as Advent, Lenten, and Vacation Bible School collection boxes; and at synagogues as tzedakah boxes.
