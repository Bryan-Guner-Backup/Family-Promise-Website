# Privacy Policy

The **Website Privacy Policy** and **Donor Privacy Policy** applicable to the Family Promise, Inc. (the “organization” or “FP”) websites are provided below. If you object to any of the terms of the Website Privacy Policy or the Donor Privacy Policy, please do not use the FP websites.

- - The Website Privacy Policy governs all interactions and communications made by visitors to the organization’s website, except where superseded by the Donor Privacy Policy.
  - The Donor Privacy Policy governs all interactions and communications made through the organization’s website in the process of making a donation through the organization’s website as well as all donations made through offline means.\*\* \*\*

**<span class="underline">Website Privacy Policy  
</span>**The following Privacy Policy applies to information collected at [www.familypromise.org](../index.html) and FP-affiliated websites featuring this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collected  
**For each visitor to this website, our web servers may automatically recognize and collect non-personally-identifiable information, such as in-bound domain names, your computer’s IP address, the type of browser in use and pages viewed. This data tells us which pages our users visit and what information they volunteer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

We only collect personally-identifiable information about you when you voluntarily submit such information to us, for example by signing up for the FP newsletter, by making a donation or by submitting information through our “Contact Us” webpage. Depending on the service you choose and the reason you are contacting us, the personally-identifiable information collected includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, address, phone number, payment details, organizational affiliation and similar or related information (“Personal Information”).

**Use of Information  
**Any Personal Information we collect is used only for internal review, to improve our web content, to optimize your web experience and, in some cases, to customize the content and/or layout of select pages.

We will only use Personal Information you provide to us (and disclose it to third parties) for the purpose for which it was provided, for example:

- - to periodically alert you to FP news and events;
  - to respond to inquiries;
  - to process donations and purchases;
  - to provide you with and improve our services to you;
  - to facilitate contact between you and our local affiliates at your request; and
  - in the course of fundraising activities.

We do not share your Personal Information with any third parties without your consent, except under the following circumstances:

- - as set forth above;
  - in response to a subpoena or when we are required to do so by applicable laws or regulations, for example, in response to a court order or other legal obligation;
  - in response to a law enforcement agency’s request;
  - to protect the security or confidentiality of our records;
  - in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to prevent actual or potential fraud or to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights;
  - in the event FP goes through a reorganization (e.g., a merger into another organization), in which case you will be notified via a prominent notice on the website of any such transfer of your Personal Information;
  - we may engage third parties which are other companies and/or individuals (agents or vendors) to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples may include providing technical assistance, mailing services, donation and purchase processing, and customer service.  These third parties will have access to Personal Information and other information only as necessary to perform their functions and to the extent permitted by law; and
  - we may share aggregated demographic information with our affiliates and other third parties. This is not linked to any Personal Information that can identify any individual person.

**Use of Cookies  
**As of the date of this policy, we do not use cookies to store or collect any Personal Information. We will update this policy in the future, in the event that we may use cookies to record past activity on our website in an effort to provide better and faster service upon your return visits to this website and/or also customize certain web content based on your browser type, bandwidth or other settings to optimize your site experience.

There may be “plug-ins” (i.e., third party software components) in the software on our website or our platform that do use cookies. Additionally, we may directly or through third party tracking software or services, collect browser information for their reporting, but not sensitive, personally identifying data, only aggregated data. Our third party payment processor collects cookies from individuals who use its service through our website. Such third party software and services, and our third party vendors may share the information collected with third party advertising networks. This is also non-personally-identifiable information such as the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, IP addresses, links to/from any page and time spent at the site.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Remember, though, without cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our website features.

**Orders  
**We request information from you on our order form or when you buy something through the online store on our website. To buy from us, you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we’ll use this information to contact you.

**Use of IP Addresses  
**We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website.

**Security  
**This site incorporates reasonable and appropriate safeguards using industry standard technology to heighten the security, accuracy and privacy of any Personal Information we have collected, and we have put in place reasonable precautions to protect information from loss and misuse. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as required.

**Linked Websites  
**Our website contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

**Children’s Privacy

No part of our website is directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under age 13.

We do not reply to information requests from children under the age of 13, if so identified.
