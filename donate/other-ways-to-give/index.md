Family Promise is the leading national nonprofit addressing family homelessness, providing homelessness prevention, emergency shelter, workforce development, education, financial capability, health and wellness, and so much more.

Family Promise is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Your gift is tax-deductible as allowed by law.

## Planned Giving Through Your Estate

Planned Giving is an effective and mutually beneficial way of giving to Family Promise. By making a planned gift, you assist us in our mission to help low-income and homeless families reclaim and maintain their independence, while enjoying the benefits of capital gains tax savings, increased income, and income-tax savings.

#### Gift Annuities

Under a gift annuity agreement, you make a gift to Family Promise in return for the organization’s promise to make an annual payment to you of a specified dollar amount for as long as you live. The amount of the annual payment depends upon your age and is based on a fixed percentage of the initial fair market value of your gift. A portion of your gift may be tax-advantaged.

#### Charitable Remainder Trusts

A charitable remainder trust may be designed to provide you with income throughout your lifetime as well as support to Family Promise upon your death. The trust may be established with a gift of cash or appreciated stock. A trust can be structured in one of two ways – either as an annuity trust or unitrust. The important difference between the two options involves the way distributions are handled.

#### Charitable Lead Trusts

Charitable lead trusts provide income to your designated charity for a set period of time. At the end of the gift period, the property you placed in the trust either returns to you, or is passed on to named individuals.

**Please [contact us](https://familypromise.org/contact/?subject=donations)** **for further information planned giving to Family Promise.**

## Give Stock

Donating appreciated stock can provide you with significant tax benefits. Your stock donation to Family Promise provides you with a charitable deduction for the full, fair-market value of stocks and securities held longer than one year.

### Frequently Asked Questions

Donor-advised funds (DAFs) are the fastest growing form of philanthropy today because they’re easy and flexible.

#### HOW DOES A DAF WORK?

Think of a donor-advised fund as a personal charitable savings account. You create a DAF and contribute to it with cash, stock, or other assets like artwork or real estate. You don’t have to name a specific recipient charity right away, and you might even be eligible to take an immediate tax deduction for your contribution.

Your DAF is controlled by a nonprofit “sponsoring organization” (such as a community foundation or the nonprofit arm of a financial services firm). The sponsor invests and manages your account, and you recommend what nonprofit(s) you’d like to support.

#### THREE CATEGORIES OF DAFS

- Commercial funds: Managed by the nonprofit side of an investment company  
  Benefits: low investment fees, easy to use
- Community foundations: Originators of the DAF concept  
  Benefits: familiar with area nonprofits, offer philanthropic counseling and can help you navigate the process
- Single-issue funds: Sponsoring organizations that encourage giving to a single cause or organization, like universities  
  benefits: easy way to donate if you have one specific charity in mind

#### WHOSE MONEY IS IT, ANYWAY?

Once you’ve created a DAF, the account belongs to the sponsoring organization in perpetuity. You can advise how to make gifts, but they’re not legally obligated to follow your advice. That said, sponsors almost always abide by a donor’s wishes (as long as the recipient is a qualifying tax-exempt organization).

#### I HAVE A PRIVATE FOUNDATION. CAN I USE IT TO FUND A DAF?

Yes!

#### ARE DAF GIFTS ANONYMOUS?

It’s up to you. Be aware that some DAF gifts don’t include the donor’s name or contact info by default, which can make it difficult for charities to identify and acknowledge your generosity. But you can ask your sponsor to clearly indicate the donation is coming from a DAF and include your contact information when a gift is made.

#### CAN I PASS MY DAF ON TO MY HEIRS?

Probably. Sponsors have their own guidelines, so if this is something you’re interested in, speak with a few different organizations to learn what your options are.

#### IF MY DAF ISN’T PASSED ON TO A SUCCESSOR, WHAT HAPPENS TO IT?

When creating your DAF, your sponsor will recommend you name any successors and/or select which charities you’d like to receive the remainder of your fund after your passing.

There are no tax rules about the amount of time money can sit in a DAF. However, many sponsors mandate regular giving. For example, you might be required to donate at least $50 every three years, and if your account is inactive for, say, five years, it could be liquidated and moved to another philanthropic fund. Typically, donors make six to seven gifts annually from a DAF.

### OTHER BENEFITS:

#### GROW YOUR DONATIONS.

Similar to a 401(k) plan, you can invest your DAF. Your sponsor can advise you on your options.

#### SIMPLIFY YOUR CHARITABLE GIVING.

Rather than writing multiple checks to various charities throughout the year – and keeping track of the associated paperwork – the DAF handles that for you. Sponsoring organizations perform due diligence to ensure charities are eligible and reputable. And they’ll track your donations throughout the year and provide a single tax document.

#### MINIMIZE YOUR TAX BURDEN, MAXIMIZE YOUR DONATION.

DAFs accept donations of appreciated securities (held for more than one year) at fair market value. If you sold the securities on your own in order to make a donation, you’d have to pay capital gains tax. Not with a DAF!

#### ALSO WORTH NOTING…

A minimum donation level, which can range anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 or more, is required to establish a DAF. You’ll also pay minimal administrative and investment fees. And gifts usually have a minimum amount, though it may be as little as $50. Inquire about these features when shopping for a sponsoring organization.
