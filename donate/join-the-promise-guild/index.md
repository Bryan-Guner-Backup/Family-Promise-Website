## WELCOME TO THE PROMISE GUILD, FAMILY PROMISE’S RECURRING GIVING PROGRAM!

Every day, 1 out of 19 children in the U.S. experiences homelessness.

Family Promise helps thousands of children and their families work their way back to independence each year through homelessness prevention, emergency shelter, and graduate support services. 81 percent of the families we serve secure housing by the time they exit our program.

Our Promise Guild members help children and families avoid or recover from homelessness every month with an automatic recurring gift to Family Promise.

Join us in the fight against family homelessness! For less than the cost of a cup of coffee every day for a month, you can help transform lives. With a monthly donation of $10 or more, you’ll receive regular updates on some of the families you’re helping and a special thank you gift from Family Promise. Plus, you’ll be listed in our annual report and event programs.

### HOW CAN YOUR GIFT HELP EACH MONTH?

- $10 can feed a child for one day
- $15 can wash nearly 100 loads of laundry
- $25 can provide a family a month’s worth of hygiene products
- $50 can give a working parent monthly transportation
- $100 can provide one day of shelter, meals, and case management for a family in need

**Join the Promise Guild and make an impact all year long!**
